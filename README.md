# imdb_movie_analysis_using_python
This project analyzes data about movies from the IMDB website. It aims to investigate "What factors influence the success of a movie on IMDB?"and identify interesting trends. The impact of this problem is significant for movie producers, directors, and investors who want to understand what makes a movie successful to make informed decisions in their future projects. 

## Dataset info
The raw dataset contains 5043 rows and 28 columns that provided all the information about IMDB ratings of various movies. The dataset includes information about various movie attributes like movie title, release year, genre, director, actor names etc.

## Analysis Techniques
This project uses Python libraries like Pandas for data manipulation, NumPy for numerical computations, and Matplotlib for data visualization. The analysis explores trends in movie genres across decades, investigates the relationship between genre and ratings, and visualizes these findings using various plots and charts.

## Key Findings
The analysis revealed that Crime|Drama|Fantasy|Mystery is the most popular genre than the other genres among users. Charles Chaplin is the director who has the highest IMDB ratings. Leonardo DiCaprio is the actor who has the highest average number of user reviews and critic reviews. Overall the number of users are increasing over the decade. English is the most popular language among users. Avatar is the most popular movie among the others. Although, after exploring the correlations between genre, director, language with IMDB ratings of movies, it is clear that these factors did not affect the IMDB ratings of a movie.
